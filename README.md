# Aircraft-Image-Classification-
The objective of this project aims in analyzing images of different aircrafts and thereby classifying different kinds of aircrafts that include drones, jets, helicopters etc. The project has useful military and defense applications relating to, but not limited to airspace management and control, airport security against unauthorized drone flights, and air space defense against aircrafts. Its applications also provide insight into other forms of image classification techniques that come handy. Such a project also deemed significant due to the increasing escalations of air-battles and the questionable credibility, efficiency and effectiveness of the different types of drones.
The dataset we are going to use is the “Flying-Planes” dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/eabdul/flying-vehicles. This dataset consists of images six features: drones (UAV), fighter jets, helicopters, passenger planes, rockets and missiles with each feature containing roughly 1200 to 1800 images for each type of aircraft. This data set was chosen because of the variety of availability of different types of aircrafts, as well as the vast number of data samples needed to train the network thoroughly.

This project is implemented using 3 data analysis algorithms: Naive Baye's Classification, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural
Networks. The accuracy and efficiency of each model is tested separately.

This project was implemented as a semester project for the course "Statistical Learning and Data Analytics" at 
the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
