# Aircraft-Image-Classification-
Classification of Aircraft Types: Drones, Helicopters, Fighter Jets, Missiles, 
Passenger Planes and Rockets based on three deep learning data analysis algorithms: 
Naive Baye's Classification, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks. 
These algorithms classify the types of aircraft based on image data and feature vector selection. 

This project was implemented as a semester project for the course "Statistical Learning and Data Analytics" at 
the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
